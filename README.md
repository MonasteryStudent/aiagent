# aiagent

This is my third project on https://www.boot.dev

This is a toy version of an aiagent and isn't perfectly secure, 
so please be very cautious about giving an LLM access to your 
filesystem and python interpreter.

Possible improvements:

- Fix harder and more complex bugs
- Refactor sections of code
- Add entirely new features

You can also try:

- Other LLM providers
- Other Gemini models
- Giving it more functions to call
- Other codebases (Commit your changes before running 
the agent so you can always revert!)
